My name is Kyle Free, I am a college Sophomore studying Finance and Computer Science. Technology is my main interest. Studying technology companies through my financial investment lens led to a fascination with technological innovation and creating software. I have recently started to teach myself software engineering to grow my skills into working at a technology company where I can create and work on technology.
